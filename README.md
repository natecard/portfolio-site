## Projects

The portfolio website has a section called "Projects" where it displays a grid of cards for each project. Each card has an image, a title, and a brief description of the project. The user can hover over the card to see more details and a link to the live site or the source code.

When the user clicks on a card, it opens a modal window that shows more information about the project, such as:

- The main features and functionalities of the project
- The technologies and tools used to build the project
- The challenges and learnings from working on the project
- The screenshots or videos of the project in action
- The testimonials or feedback from the clients or users of the project

The user can close the modal window by clicking on the "X" button or pressing the "Esc" key. The user can also navigate through the projects using the left and right arrow keys or buttons.
