					Hi there! My name is Nate I'm a software developer who loves creating innovative solutions
					that make a positive impact on products. As an entrepreneur, I was always fascinated by
					how technology can transform our lives and solve complex problems. That's what motivated
					me to pursue a career in software development.
					<br />
					<br />
					I learned Full Stack Development through The Odin Project, an open source coding
					curriculum that taught me everything I needed to know to build awesome websites and apps.
					I learned JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and Node.js.
					<br />
					<br />
					I am currently looking to work as either a Front End or Full Stack developer, and look
					forward to working with a great team to move their product forward.
