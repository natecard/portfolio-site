					Hi there! My name is Nate, I am a Full Stack Developer based in Ontario, Canada. Currently
					I am studying a Master of Science in Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence and Machine
					Learning at the University of York.
					<br />
					<br />
					My journey began learning Web Development through The Odin Project. I learned the basic
					skills for Web Development like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js. This opened my eyes to
					the world of software development as a whole. I then decided to pursue a Master&rsquo;s
					degree in Computer Science to expand on my knowledge, especially in the Machine Learning
					and AI field.
					<br />
					<br />
					Now my focus is on learning and developing my skills with Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow and
					other ML related frameworks. I am currently focusing on GNNs and Computer Vision, but I am
					eager to learn more about other fields in AI and ML.
